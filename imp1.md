Okay, this is a fantastic use case for `smolagents`! We'll combine a powerful LLM, custom tools for Git interaction and date handling, and a conversational loop for user feedback.

Here's a detailed implementation plan:

**Objective:** Create a `smolagents`-based system that takes a user's blog post prompt, generates a draft in the user's style and blog's Markdown format, allows for iterative feedback and revision, and upon approval, commits the new post to a specified GitHub repository.

**Core Components:**

1.  **LLM Model:** A capable model for content generation and understanding instructions (e.g., `InferenceClientModel` with Llama 3, `LiteLLMModel` with Claude 3.5 Sonnet or GPT-4o).
2.  **Agent:** A `CodeAgent` will be most suitable as it can execute Python code for date handling and will be given a custom tool for Git operations.
3.  **Custom Tools:**
    *   `GitHubCommitTool`: To handle Git operations (pull, add, commit, push).
    *   `GetCurrentDateTool`: To get the current date for the blog post filename and frontmatter.
    *   (Potentially) `FileReaderTool`: To read example blog posts for style and format.
4.  **User Interaction Loop:** A Python script that manages the conversation between the user and the agent.

---

**Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Setup and Configuration**

1.  **Environment Setup:**
    *   Install `smolagents` and necessary extras: `pip install smolagents[transformers]` or `smolagents[litellm]` etc.
    *   Install `GitPython` for easier Git interactions within the custom tool: `pip install GitPython`.
    *   Set up API keys (Hugging Face Token, OpenAI/Anthropic API key, etc.) as environment variables or pass them to the model.
    *   Ensure Git is installed and configured on the machine where the agent will run (for CLI access if `GitPython` proves tricky, or for `GitPython` to use).
    *   Clone the user's blog repository locally. The agent will operate on this local clone.

2.  **LLM and Agent Initialization:**
    *   Choose and initialize your preferred LLM model (e.g., `InferenceClientModel`).
    *   Define the path to the local clone of the blog repository. This will be needed by the `GitHubCommitTool`.
    *   Define the path to the `_posts` directory within the blog.

**Phase 2: Custom Tool Development**

1.  **`GetCurrentDateTool`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Get the current date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.
    *   **Implementation (using `@tool` decorator):**
        ```python
        from smolagents import tool
        from datetime import datetime

        @tool
        def get_current_date_tool() -> str:
            """
            Returns the current date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
            This is useful for naming blog posts and setting the date in the frontmatter.
            """
            return datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
        ```

2.  **`GitHubCommitTool`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Adds a new file to a Git repository, commits it, and pushes it.
    *   **Inputs:** `file_path` (relative to repo root, e.g., `_posts/YYYY-MM-DD-my-new-post.md`), `file_content` (string), `commit_message` (string), `repo_path` (string, absolute path to the local Git repo).
    *   **Implementation (using `@tool` decorator and `GitPython`):**
        ```python
        from smolagents import tool
        import os
        from git import Repo, GitCommandError # pip install GitPython

        @tool
        def github_commit_tool(repo_path: str, relative_file_path: str, file_content: str, commit_message: str) -> str:
            """
            Adds a new file to the specified local Git repository, commits it, and pushes to the default remote (origin/main or origin/master).
            Args:
                repo_path: The absolute local path to the Git repository.
                relative_file_path: The path of the file to be created/updated, relative to the repository root (e.g., '_posts/2023-10-27-new-post.md').
                file_content: The content to write into the file.
                commit_message: The commit message.

                print(f"Pulling latest changes from origin/{default_branch_name}...")
                origin = repo.remotes.origin
                origin.pull()

                # Create/Update the file

                print(f"File '{relative_file_path}' added to index.")
                repo.index.commit(commit_message)
                print(f"Committed with message: '{commit_message}'")

                print(f"Pushing to origin/{default_branch_name}...")
                origin.push()
                print("Push successful.")
                return f"Successfully created, committed, and pushed '{relative_file_path}' with message: '{commit_message}'."

                print(f"Git command error: {e}")
                return f"Error during Git operation: {e}. Please check Git setup and repository state."
            except Exception as e:

                return f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}"
        ```
    *   **Security Note:** This tool writes files and executes Git commands. Ensure `repo_path` is trustworthy.

3.  **(Optional) `FileReaderTool`:**
    *   **Purpose:** Read existing blog posts to provide style/format examples to the LLM.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```python
        @tool
        def read_file_tool(file_path: str) -> str:
            """
            Reads the content of a specified file.
            Args:
                file_path: The absolute path to the file to read.
            """
            try:
                with open(file_path, "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
                    return f.read()
            except Exception as e:
                return f"Error reading file {file_path}: {e}"
        ```
    *   **Alternative:** Instead of a tool, the main script can read these files and inject their content into the initial prompt. This might be simpler and more secure.

**Phase 3: Agent Logic - Initial Post Generation**

1.  **Gathering Context:**
    *   The main script will prompt the user for the blog post topic/idea.
    *   The script will read 1-2 existing blog posts from the user's local repository (e.g., from `_posts/`) to serve as style and format examples.
        *   Crucially, extract the Jekyll frontmatter structure (e.g., `layout`, `title`, `date`, `tags`, `categories`).

2.  **Crafting the Initial System Prompt and Task for the Agent:**
    *   The system prompt for the `CodeAgent` will include descriptions of the available tools (`get_current_date_tool`, `github_commit_tool`).
    *   The initial task prompt given to `agent.run()` will be structured like this:

        ```
        You are a helpful AI assistant that helps write blog posts for a personal Jekyll blog.
        Your goal is to generate a new blog post based on the user's topic.

        **User's Topic:** "{user_provided_topic}"

        **Style and Tone Guidelines:**
        Please emulate the style and tone of the following example posts:
        --- EXAMPLE POST 1 ---
        {content_of_example_post_1}
        --- END EXAMPLE POST 1 ---

        --- EXAMPLE POST 2 ---
        {content_of_example_post_2}
        --- END EXAMPLE POST 2 ---

        **Formatting Requirements (Jekyll Markdown):**
        The post MUST be in Markdown format.
        It MUST include Jekyll frontmatter at the very beginning, enclosed by triple hyphens (---).
        The frontmatter should include:
        - layout: post (or other layout if specified in examples)
        - title: [A suitable title for the blog post, based on the topic]
        - date: [Use the get_current_date_tool() to get today's date in YYYY-MM-DD format, and then format it as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-ZZZZ, e.g., 2023-10-27 10:00:00 -0700. You can assume 10:00:00 for the time and your local timezone offset or a common one like -0700 or +0000]
        - (Include other common frontmatter fields from the examples, like 'tags', 'categories', 'excerpt_separator', etc.)

        The filename for the post should be in the format: YYYY-MM-DD-slugified-title.md.
        A slugified title is lowercase, with spaces replaced by hyphens, and special characters removed.

        **Your Task:**
        1. Generate a compelling title for the blog post based on the user's topic.
        2. Use the `get_current_date_tool()` to get today's date.
        3. Construct the full blog post content, including the Jekyll frontmatter and the main body.
        4. The main body should be well-structured, engaging, and match the style of the examples.
        5. Output the complete Markdown content of the blog post (frontmatter + body). Do NOT try to commit it yet. Just provide the content for review.
           Use the `print()` function to output the full markdown content.
        ```

**Phase 4: Agent Logic - Review & Revision Loop (Managed by the main Python script)**

1.  **Initial Generation:**
    *   The main script initializes the `CodeAgent` with the custom tools.
    *   It runs the agent with the detailed prompt from Phase 3. `agent.run(initial_task_prompt)`
    *   The agent will (hopefully) `print()` the generated Markdown. The main script needs to capture this output (e.g., by temporarily redirecting `sys.stdout` if the agent's `print` output isn't directly returned or easily accessible in logs for this purpose, or by checking `agent.logs` for `print` outputs). A better way is to instruct the agent to use `final_answer("markdown content here")` if we want a structured return. For this iterative process, having it `print` the draft might be fine if we can capture it.
        *   *Refinement:* Instruct the agent to explicitly call `final_answer(generated_markdown_content)` for the draft. This makes it easier to retrieve.

2.  **User Review:**
    *   The main script displays the generated Markdown to the user.
    *   It prompts the user: "Review the draft. Type your feedback, or 'approve' to commit, or 'deny' to stop."

3.  **Iteration:**
    *   **If feedback:**
        *   The main script constructs a new task for the agent:
            ```
            The user has reviewed the previous draft and provided feedback.
            Previous Draft:
            ---
            {previous_draft_markdown}
            ---
            User's Feedback: "{user_feedback}"

            Please revise the draft based on this feedback, keeping the style and formatting requirements in mind.
            Output the complete revised Markdown content. Use final_answer(revised_markdown_content).
            ```
        *   Run the agent again: `agent.run(revision_task_prompt, reset=False)` (crucial: `reset=False` keeps the conversation history and tool awareness).
        *   Go back to step 2 (User Review).
    *   **If 'deny':** The script terminates.
    *   **If 'approve':** Proceed to Phase 5.

**Phase 5: Agent Logic - Finalization & Commit (Triggered by user 'approve')**

1.  **Prepare for Commit:**
    *   The main script has the approved Markdown content.
    *   It needs to instruct the agent to perform the commit.
    *   The agent will need:
        *   The current date (again, for the filename, though it might have it from generation).
        *   The title (to slugify for the filename). The LLM should have generated this.
        *   The approved Markdown content.

2.  **Task for Commit:**
    *   The main script constructs a new task:
        ```
        The user has approved the following blog post content:
        --- APPROVED CONTENT ---
        {approved_markdown_content}
        --- END APPROVED CONTENT ---

        The title of this post is: "{extracted_title_from_frontmatter}" (You might need to extract this from the frontmatter if not explicitly stated).

        Your tasks are:
        1. Use `get_current_date_tool()` to get the current date (e.g., "2023-10-27").
        2. Create a slugified version of the title (e.g., "my-awesome-new-post").
        3. Construct the full filename: "{date}-{slugified_title}.md" (e.g., "2023-10-27-my-awesome-new-post.md").
        4. The file should be placed in the '_posts/' directory of the repository. So the relative path will be '_posts/{filename}'.
        5. Use the `github_commit_tool()` to:
            - Save the APPROVED CONTENT to this `relative_file_path` within the repository located at `{path_to_local_blog_repo}`.
            - Use the commit message: "Add new blog post: {extracted_title_from_frontmatter}"
        6. Report the outcome of the `github_commit_tool()`. Use final_answer(tool_output).
        ```

3.  **Execute Commit:**
    *   `agent.run(commit_task_prompt, reset=False)`
    *   The main script displays the result from `final_answer()` (which should be the output of `github_commit_tool`).

**Phase 6: Putting It All Together (Main Python Script)**

**Key Considerations & Refinements:**

*   **Prompt Engineering:** The quality of the initial prompt and feedback prompts is paramount. Be very specific about Jekyll frontmatter, Markdown structure, and style.
*   **Error Handling:** The `GitHubCommitTool` has basic error handling. More robust error handling can be added (e.g., if Git isn't configured, if the repo path is wrong, if there are merge conflicts during pull). The main script should also handle cases where the agent fails or returns unexpected output.
*   **Slugification:** The LLM will be asked to slugify the title. This can be error-prone. A Python utility function for slugification could be added and the agent instructed to use it, or the main script could do the slugification before passing the filename to the commit tool.
*   **Extracting Title:** Reliably extracting the title from the LLM's generated frontmatter for the commit message and filename can be tricky. You might instruct the LLM to *also* output the title as a separate piece of information in an earlier step.
*   **Idempotency:** The `GitHubCommitTool` should ideally handle cases where a file with the same name already exists (e.g., overwrite or fail). The current version will overwrite.
*   **Security:**
    *   The `LOCAL_BLOG_REPO_PATH` should be a trusted path.
    *   API keys should be handled securely (environment variables are good).
    *   Review the code generated/executed by the `CodeAgent` if `add_base_tools=True` is used, although here we are relying on our custom tools.
*   **LLM Choice:** A more powerful LLM will generally follow complex instructions better and produce higher-quality content.
*   **Iterative Development:** Start with generating the content, then add the review loop, and finally the Git commit functionality. Test each part thoroughly.

This plan provides a comprehensive roadmap. You'll likely need to tweak prompts and tool interactions as you build and test. Good luck!
